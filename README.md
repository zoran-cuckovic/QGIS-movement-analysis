# QGIS-movement-analysis
A plugin for raster based modeling of movement (cost surface, least-cost path)
## Requirements
Featured algorithms run on Python Scikit-Image library, which is not included in regular QGIS installation. If missing, you should install the library with following command 
``` pip --default-timeout=1000 install scikit-image```

In Windows, this is executed in OSGeo4W Shell (see my tutorial : https://landscapearchaeology.org/2018/installing-python-packages-in-qgis-3-for-windows/)


## Instalation
Download the code (green button) and install manually in QGIS (Plugins >> Manage >> Install from ZIP).
