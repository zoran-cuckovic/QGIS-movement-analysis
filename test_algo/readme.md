These files can be used for testing purposes; a DEM extract is provided (France, EPSG : 2154), a friction surface (using W. Tobler's hiking formula) and two sets of points. 

The set of four test sites can be used for optimal path tracing. Pay attention to the maximum distance parameter. 

The point grid (in the same .gpkg file) can be used for testing various forms of accumulated cost surface models or accumulated paths.
